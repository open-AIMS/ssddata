abstract = {Abstract The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) is a statistical approach that is used to estimate either the concentration of a chemical that is hazardous to no more than x\% of all species (the HCx) or the proportion of species potentially affected by a given concentration of a chemical. Despite a significant body of published research and critical reviews over the past 20 years aimed at improving the methodology, the fundamentals remain unchanged. While there have been some recent suggestions for improvements to SSD methods in the literature, in general, few of these suggestions have been formally adopted. Further, critics of the approach can rightly point to the fact that differences in technical implementation can lead to marked differences in results, thereby undermining confidence in SSD approaches. Despite the limitations, SSDs remain a practical tool and, until a demonstrably better inferential framework is available, developments and enhancements to conventional SSD practice will and should continue. We therefore believe the time has come for the scientific community to decide how it wants SSD methods to evolve. The current paper summarises the current status of, and elaborates on several recent developments for, SSD methods, specifically, model averaging, multimodality and software development. The paper also considers future directions with respect to the use of SSDs, with the ultimate aim of helping to facilitate greater international collaboration and, potentially, greater harmonization of SSD methods.

@article{Batley2020,
abstract = {Chlorination is commonly used to control biofouling organisms, but chlorine rapidly hydrolyzes in seawater to hypochlorite, which undergoes further reaction with bromide, and then with organic matter. These reaction products, collectively termed chlorine-produced oxidants (CPOs), can be toxic to marine biota. Because the lifetime of the most toxic forms is limited to several days, appropriate guideline values need to be based on short-term (acute) toxicity tests, rather than chronic tests. Flow-through toxicity tests that provide continuous CPO exposure are the most appropriate, whereas static-renewal tests generate variable exposure and effects depending on the renewal rate. There are literature data for acute CPO toxicity from flow-through tests, together with values from 2 sensitive 15-min static tests on 30 species from 9 taxonomic groups. These values were used in a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) to derive guideline values that were protective of 99, 95, and 90% of species at 2.2, 7.2, and 13 µg CPO/L respectively. These are the first marine guideline values for chlorine to be derived using SSDs, with all other international guideline values based on the use of assessment factors applied to data for the most sensitive species. In applying these conservative guideline values in field situations, it would need to be demonstrated that concentrations of CPOs would be reduced to below the guideline value within an acceptable mixing zone through both dilution and dissociation.

@article{Stauber2021,
abstract = {There has been an increased emphasis on incorporating bioavailability-based approaches into freshwater guideline value derivations for metals in the Australian and New Zealand water quality guidelines. Four bioavailability models were compared: the existing European biotic ligand model (European Union BLM) and a softwater BLM, together with 2 newly developed multiple linear regressions (MLRs)-a trophic level-specific MLR and a pooled MLR. Each of the 4 models was used to normalize a nickel ecotoxicity dataset (combined tropical and temperate data) to an index condition of pH 7.5, 6 mg Ca/L, 4 mg Mg/L, (i.e., approximately 30 mg CaCO 3 /L hardness), and 0.5 mg DOC/L. The trophic level-specific MLR outperformed the other 3 models, with 79% of the predicted 10% effect concentration (EC10) values within a factor of 2 of the observed EC10 values. All 4 models gave similar normalized species sensitivity distributions and similar estimates of protective concentrations (PCs). Based on the index condition water chemistry proposed as the basis of the national guideline value, a protective concentration for 95% of species (PC95) of 3 µg Ni/L was derived. This guideline value can be adjusted up and down to account for site-specific water chemistries. Predictions of PC95 values for 20 different typical water chemistries for Australia and New Zealand varied by >40-fold, which confirmed that correction for nickel bioavailability is critical for the derivation of site-specific guideline values.},
